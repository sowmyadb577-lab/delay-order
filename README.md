# delay-order

> Delivery delay analysis project for logistics and supply chain optimization

## 📋 Overview

The **delay-order** project is a comprehensive delivery delay analysis system designed to help logistics companies and supply chain managers identify, analyze, and predict delivery delays. By processing historical delivery data, this tool provides actionable insights to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## 🚀 Features

- **Delay Detection**: Automatically identify delayed deliveries based on configurable thresholds
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Categorize and analyze reasons for delivery delays
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast potential delays using historical patterns
- **Performance Metrics**: Track key performance indicators (KPIs) for delivery operations
- **Data Visualization**: Generate charts and reports for stakeholder communication
- **Export Capabilities**: Export analysis results in various formats (CSV, JSON, Excel)
